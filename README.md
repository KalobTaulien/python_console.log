# python_console.log
Its about time that python got a console.log

For years, JavaScript developers have had a one up on Python, by being able to print whatever they like to the console using the infamous `console.log` command. It's about time python had this killer functionality. I've managed to replicate this behavior using state of the art python class(es).

## Usage
`
import console.py

console.log('debug message!')
`

### What's Next? 

I'm accepting pull requests to enhance functionality. I can't do this by myself people.
